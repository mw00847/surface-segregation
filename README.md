# surface segregation of polymers

Surface energy is the free energy per unit area of creating an interface with air or vacuum. Surface tension is the force per unit length along the surface opposing the interface of air or vacuum (1). The surface of polymer blends is often different from the bulk material. This in itself provides the opportunity to add functionality at the surface interface for coatings and paints to have properties such as corrosion inhibition, hydrophobicity, conductance and chemical resistance to name just a few.     

Predicting the surface composition is often determined initially by the component with the lowest surface energy (1,2). However the structure (entropic) and functional groups (enthalpic) contributions have shown to contradict the surface energy belief.

In this work molecular dynamics simulations of polymer blends with different surface energies are compared.  The polymer weight and concentration is varied.  The MARTINI forcefield is used with GROMACS to create a periodic box with two interfaces.  The partial density function in GROMACS is then used to identify the position of the polymer across the box.
