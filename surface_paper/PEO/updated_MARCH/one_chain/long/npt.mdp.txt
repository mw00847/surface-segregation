; MARTINI and TEMPERATURE/PRESSURE
; Good temperature control can be achieved with the velocity rescale (V-rescale)
; thermostat using a coupling constant of the order of 1 ps. Even better 
; temperature control can be achieved by reducing the temperature coupling 
; constant to 0.1 ps, although with such tight coupling (approaching 
; the time step) one can no longer speak of a weak-coupling scheme.
; We therefore recommend a coupling time constant of at least 0.5 ps.
; The Berendsen thermostat is less suited since it does not give
; a well described thermodynamic ensemble.
; 
; Pressure can be controlled with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat, 
; with a coupling constant in the range 4-8 ps and typical compressibility 
; in the order of 10e-4 - 10e-5 bar-1. Note that, for equilibration purposes, 
; the Berendsen barostat probably gives better results, as the Parrinello-
; Rahman is prone to oscillating behaviour. For bilayer systems the pressure 
; coupling should be done semiisotropic.

; pressure coupling either Beresden or V-rescale?
